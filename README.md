What' this then ?

I have wanted to REALLY learn glsl / shaders and the related maths etc for years now.
Now I am actually learning.
One mistake and half baked experiment at a time.

This means a mix and match of code taken from fantastic sources such as [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
and from [The book of shaders](http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/2015/thebookofshaders/08/)
and smashed together, commented to oblivion to gain understanding etc.

I don't claim to understand everything, or that all code comes from me, I am just a humble
beginner standing on the shoulder of giants, greatfully.


## General information


 - for fun and learning
 - I might structure this better at some point, but my focus for now is to learn, have fun
 experiment, and share it if it can help anyone
 - uses a bit of [glsify(https://github.com/stackgl/glslify) for some experiments
 - the potentially fantastic [regl](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/regl) (declarative stateless rendering)


## What are you trying to learn exactly ?

- glsl in general
- shaders basics and tricks
- improving my math : gain a thorough understanding of transforms , matrix operations, etc
- basics of lighting (reimplimenting basic and less basic lighting systems, 'manually', and
gaining an **understanding** of various lighting models , not just copy & pasting code )
- signed distance function and ray-marching
- ???

## OK I'm sold (really ????) where are the goods

- they are not good, but they are [here](https://github.com/kaosat-dev/shader-fu/tree/master/src/shaders)
